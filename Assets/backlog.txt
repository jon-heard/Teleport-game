- unducking with something above your head forces non-unduck
- noninstant unducking
- Setup a ui for internal to select inventory items (on side to see scene)
- have internal mouse over scenery show tooltip with description of what look at
	- highlight what is being looked at (make it super colorful?)
	- can use texture to determine description (default for walls, etc)
- Setup a seperate gun
- rotation of rigidbody is choppy
